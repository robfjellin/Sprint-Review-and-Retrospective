How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Software development from what Iknow is about solving problems for users, and understanding their needs. User stories help to serve as a powerful bridge between user requirements. 
When using Agile methodologies I believe it provides a flexible and efficient framework for developing. Agile has iterative development with regular feedback. This allows teams to adapt to ever-changing requirements and incrementally improve.
Being a good team member as it pertains to software developments requires both technical excellence and strong interpersonal skills.
